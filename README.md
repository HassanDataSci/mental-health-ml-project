# Mental Health in Tech - ML Project

This project explores mental health in the tech industry using a machine learning approach. The goal is to predict whether a person has sought treatment for mental health issues based on survey responses.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
- Features: Age, Gender, Work Environment, Benefits, etc.
- Target Variable: `treatment` (Yes/No)

## 🧠 ML Approach
- Problem Type: Binary Classification
- Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Best Accuracy: ~84.8% with SVM

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
2. One-hot Encoding for Categorical Features
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Model Comparison using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## 📈 Results
SVM gave the best performance with an F1-score of 0.85.

## 🔒 Private Repo
This is a private academic project. Access is limited to course TAs and instructors.
